\chapter{Research method}
\label{chap:method}
%\emph{Here you describe the methods used to answer the research questions. A good structure of this section often follows the subquestions by providing a method for each. The research method needs a thorough motivation grounded in theory in order to be acceptable. As a part of the method, you can introduce a number of hypotheses | these will be tested by the research, using the methods described here. An important part of this section is validation. How will you evaluate and validate the outcomes of the research?}
