\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}
%\emph{This chapter contains the analysis and interpretation of the results. The research questions are answered as best as possible with the results that were obtained. The analysis also discussed parts of the questions that were left unanswered. An important topic is the validity of the results. What methods of validation were used? Could the results be generalised to other cases? What threats to validity can be identified? There is room here to discuss the results of related scientific literature here as well. How do the results obtained here relate to other work, and what consequences are there? Did your approach work better or worse? Did you learn anything new compared to the already existing body of knowledge? Finally, what could you say in hindsight on the research approach by followed? What could have done better? What lessons have been learned? What could other researchers use from your experience? A separate section should be devoted to future work", i.e., possible extension points of your work that you have identified. Even other researchers should be able to use those as a starting point.}
